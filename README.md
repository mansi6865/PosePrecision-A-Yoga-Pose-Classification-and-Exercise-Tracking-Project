Human pose detection is the task of estimating the pose of a person in an image or video. The pose includes the location and orientation of various body parts, such as the head, torso, arms, and legs. The goal of pose detection is to identify the key points or landmarks on the body and then estimate their spatial relationships with each other. Yoga pose estimation is a subfield of human pose estimation that aims to accurately and efficiently estimate yoga poses from images or videos.
The problem statement of yoga pose estimation is to develop computer vision algorithms that can detect and track the position of specific body joints and estimate the pose of the body during a yoga practice.
There is a lack of large-scale datasets and benchmarks specifically designed for yoga pose estimation, which limits the development and evaluation of accurate and efficient algorithms. Therefore, the problem statement of yoga pose estimation is to develop robust and efficient algorithms that can accurately estimate yoga poses from images and videos.
